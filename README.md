# HumaneHousing

## Inspiration

Itâ€™s hard to imagine building a successful life without a place to call home. This basic necessity is often out of reach for formerly incarcerated people.

23.1% of houseless people at a New York City shelter have been incarcerated within the previous two years.

Humane housing aims to combat the housing crisis for formerly incarcerated persons. We aim to break down barriers to resources and reduce friction with connect FIP's to accessible housing.

Humane housing is humanizing the exchange between FIP's and property owners by building trust step-by-step.
